# Goldman-Sachs-VEP
Gained exposure to password encryption algorithms like MD5, SHA. 
Was able to find out the hashing algorithm that was used on a certain leaked passwords dump and also find the password policy of the organization.
Based on the findings and analysis, I was able to make a few recommendations that could be used to improve the password policy of the said organization so as to strengthen the passwords of the users.

Along with my solution file, I've also added the password dump file to this repo.
